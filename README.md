# Smart Plant Monitoring ðŸŒ±

This project uses IoT to monitor soil moisture in a plant pot and automatically control irrigation, ensuring plants receive the right amount of water.

## Project Status: **Designing**
Currently, I am in the design phase, working on the system architecture, choosing components, and planning the circuit. The focus is on ensuring the accuracy of moisture readings and the integration of automatic irrigation control.

## Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino or ESP32
- **Sensors**: Capacitive and resistive soil moisture sensors
- **Connection**: WiFi for communication with a mobile/web application
- **Language**: C/C++ (Arduino IDE)

## Features (Planned)
- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture
- Automated irrigation control
- WiFi alerts in case of low moisture

## Installation (Future)
Instructions for installation will be added once the project reaches the implementation phase.

## Circuit Diagram
